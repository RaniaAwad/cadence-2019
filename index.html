<p> Name: Rania Awad </p>
<p> Age: 15 </p>
<p> School: Archbishop Mitty High School </p> <img src = "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1001577308816265222/YNKzUClM.jpg" height = "100"/>

<h3> Affiliations: </h3>
<p> I am a part of my school’s Speech and Debate and Robotics teams, MSD and TKO respectively. So far in Speech, I have competed in Dramatic Interpretation, Original Prose and Poetry, and Duo Interpretation. For Robotics, I have been a part of Electronics for two years, but moving forward, I will be a part of Business as the lead manager. I am also part of Aswat, an Arabic choir, that celebrates diversity and respect for all. This summer, I have started in Girls Who Code to hopefully learn more about Computer Science and explore the field some more. </p>

<h3> Hobbies: </h3>
<p> In my free time, I enjoy sketching people and improving my art. Singing is a passion of mine and I usually accompany myself with piano, although I have to admit that I am not that great at either. Occasionally, I will take a walk or hike with my parents and if we’re feeling up to it, my mom and I will go out for a quick bike around the neighborhood. </p>

<h3> Favorite Foods: </h3>
